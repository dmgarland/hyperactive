In crabgrass, we want plugins to be able to override the views in the
main application. This is not possible in normal engines plugins.

Also, it is nice, and timetimes necessary, to be able to turn off the
default behavior of how rails loads plugins. Normally, plugins are loaded
once. It is nice to change this if you are developing a plugin (so that you
don't have to restart the server on each change) and it is necessary to
change this if any main application classes are first loaded from your plugin
(because in these cases, by default they will stick around but then get loaded
somewhere else and rails will freak out).

Here we provide two options that can be set in a plugin's init.rb:

  self.override_views = true
  self.load_once = false

Here is another way of achieving the load_once=false effect:

  # application are ignored.

  # Defaults to false.
  attr_accessor :override_views

  # Plugins may set this to false in order to prevent their code from caching
  # in development mode (in other words, false will force the code to loaded
  # on each request).

  # Some plugins have a problem: if a plugin applies a mixing directly to a 
  # model in app/models, this mixin gets unloaded by rails after the first request.
  # This only happens in development mode. The symptom is an application that works
  # for the first request but fails on subsiquent requests. 
  #
  # This is an attempt to get around that problem by re-applying any mixin
  # that modifies the core models on each request. 
  # 
  # Normal plugins don't have this problem: they modify active record, and then
  # the core models call these extensions which triggers the reloading of the 
  # plugin mixin.
