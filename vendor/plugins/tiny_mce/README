TinyMCE
=======

This plugin provides for the installation and utilization of TinyMCE in Ruby on Rails applications. 
TinyMCE is a WYSIWYG HTML editing component released under the GNU Public License (GPL) 
by Moxiecode Systems (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/).

This plugin is a modified version of the tiny_mce plugin by Blake Watters <blake@near-time.com>, 
updated by David Hrycyszyn, Stuart Chinery.

Bundled TinyMCE version: 3.1.1

Installation
============

<tt>script/plugin install svn://collaboration.headlondon.com/minuet/trunk/minuet/vendor/plugins/tiny_mce</tt>

Run: rake tinymce:scripts:install 

This will install version 3.1.1 of TinyMCE into your public/javascripts folder.  At that point, you 
can do something like this in a controller:

class FooController < ApplicationController

  uses_tiny_mce(:options => {:theme => 'advanced',
                :editor_selector => "editor",
                :theme_advanced_toolbar_location => "top",
                :theme_advanced_toolbar_align => "left",
                :theme_advanced_statusbar_location => "bottom",
                :theme_advanced_resizing => true,
                :theme_advanced_resize_horizontal => false,
                :theme_advanced_resizing_use_cookie => true,
                :paste_auto_cleanup_on_paste => true,
                :theme_advanced_buttons1 => %w{bold italic underline separator bullist numlist separator link unlink separator formatselect separator charmap separator cut copy paste pastetext pasteword separator selectall separator undo redo separator cleanup code},
                :theme_advanced_buttons2 => [],
                :theme_advanced_buttons3 => [],
                :plugins => %w{paste cleanup}}),
                :only => [:new, :edit, :create, :update])

  # all other code in your controller works normally, don't do anything special to them.
                
end

This will automatically set up a TinyMCE editor on any textarea in the views for the new, edit, 
create, or update actions which has the class 'editor' on it, like so:

<%= text_area :foo, :body, :class => 'editor' %>

(Replace the text area declaration with your own method signature, the important thing is that the class
is declared as 'editor' in this case).  Of course, you could omit the :editor_selector option in the
controller, and TinyMC would just bind to every text area in the views for the :only actions. You can also
omit all options and just put

uses_tiny_mce 

in your controller and get a simple text editor by default.
