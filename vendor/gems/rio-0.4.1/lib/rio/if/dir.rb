module RIO
  module IF
    module Dir
      # Calls ::Dir#chdir.
      #
      # Changes the current working directory of the process to the directory specified by the Rio. 
      # Raises a SystemCallError (probably Errno::ENOENT) if the target directory does not exist or 
      # if the Rio does not reference a directory.
      #
      # If a block is given changes to the directory specified by the rio for the length of the block
      # and changes back outside the block
      #
      # Returns the Rio
      #
      #  rio('/home').chdir  # change the current working directory to /home
      #  # the working directory here is /home
      #  rio('/tmp/data/mydata').delete!.mkpath.chdir {
      #     # the working directory here is /tmp/data/mydata
      #  }

      # Calls Find#find
      #
      # Uses ::Find#find to find all entries recursively for a Rio that 
      # specifies a directory. Note that there are other ways to recurse through
      # a directory structure using a Rio. See IF::Grande#each and IF::GrandeEntry#all.
      #
      # Calls the block passing a Rio for each entry found. The Rio inherits
      # file attrubutes from the directory Rio.
      #
      # Returns itself
      #
      #  rio('adir').find { |entrio| puts "#{entrio}: #{entrio.file?}" }

      #  rio('adir').chomp.find do |entrio|

      # Calls ::Dir#glob
      #
      # Returns the filenames found by expanding the pattern given in string, 
      # either as an array or as parameters to the block. In both cases the filenames
      # are expressed as a Rio.
      # Note that this pattern is not a regexp (it’s closer to a shell glob). 
      # See File::fnmatch for details of file name matching and the meaning of the flags parameter.

      # Calls ::Dir#rmdir
      #
      # Deletes the directory referenced by the Rio. 
      # Raises a subclass of SystemCallError if the directory isn’t empty.
      # Returns the Rio. If the directory does not exist, just returns the Rio.

      #
      # Removes a directory Rio recursively. Returns the Rio. 
      # If the directory does not exist, simply returns the Rio
      #
      # If called with a block, behaves as if <tt>rmtree.each(&block)</tt> had been called
      # 
      # See also IF::Grande#delete!

      # Calls FileUtils#mkpath
      #
      # Makes a new directory named by the Rio and any directories in its path that do not exist.
      # 
      # Returns the Rio. If the directory already exists, just returns the Rio.
