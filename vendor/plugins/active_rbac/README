ActiveRBAC for Rails 1.2

Porting ActiveRBAC to Rails 1.2 and Engines 1.2

It was my goal to change as less as possible in ActiveRBAC for the porting to 1.2.
For the porting itself only two things had to be made:

1. Changes in the config part

Module.config has been removed in Engines 1.2. So I had to use mattr_accessor instead. 
I have initialized the default values in lib/active_rbac.rb.
I adapted the config calls within ActiveRBAC code to fit to that change.
I have removed init_engine, because it's obsolute in Engines 1.2 and lib/active_rbac_config.rb, 
I  replaced by lib/active_rbac.rb.

You can overwrite the default values in environment.rb. 
For example: ActiveRbac.controller_layout = "MyLayout" 
You don't need Engines.start for Engines 1.2 either.

2. Changes in the naming 

Rails 1.2 is more strict, so folder lib/active_rbac becomes lib/active_rbac_mixins. 
The files have been renamed, because if you are locking for ActiveRbacMixins::UserMixins, 
the file should be named active_rbac_mixins/user_mixins.rb and not .../user_mixin.rb.  

That was what I had to do, to get ActiveRBAC up and running on Rails 1.2 and Engines 1.2..

What is missing at the moment is support of REST by using map.resources in the controllers.
Probably I will add this later.

Backward compability

This version is not designed for the use with Rails 1.1.x
