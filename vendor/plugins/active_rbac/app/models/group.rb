# The Group class represents a group record in the database and thus a group
# in the ActiveRbac model. Groups are arranged in trees and have a title.
# Groups have an arbitrary number of roles and users assigned to them. Child
# groups inherit all roles from their parents.
#
# The Group ActiveRecord class mixes in the "ActiveRbacMixins::GroupMixins::*" modules.
# These modules contain the actual implementation. It is kept there so
# you can easily provide your own model files without having to all lines
# from the engine's directory
