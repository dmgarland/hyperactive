Welcome to the Hyperactive news-reporting and community system.  This project allows you
to run your own news site, and has an extensive feature set, including:

 * Articles
 * Events
 * Video upload and conversion, including Bittorrent creation
 * Pulling in RSS feeds from other places on the internet
 * A fairly sophisticated role-based access control system so you can create your own
   roles and permissions for different kinds of users.
 * A system of Groups so people can have their own mini-website for their group.

The ideas for the project came mainly from Indymedia London (see: http://london.indymedia.org.uk) 
but the site code could potentially be used for many different purposes.

For more information, or to get involved with development, see the project site at:

Please file tickets there for any features you'd like or problems you find with the site.

There is a reasonable amount of rdoc documentation built into the site's source code,
if you want to see it you can execute

rake doc:app

from the command line.

Enjoy!
