      # a +read+ on a directory it knows to use Dir#open and call Dir#read. When it encounters a IF::RubyIO#puts, it knows
      # to perform a File#open, and call IO#puts on the returned handle. By default when a method requires

      # the operation being performed. The #a method only affects how Rio opens a file when
      # it sees an operator that requires writing, and must determine for itself how to open it.

      # When a block is passed directly to the rio constructor +closeoncopy+ is turned off.
      #
      #  rio('afile') { |file|
      #    file.closeoncopy? #=> false
      #    file < a_string
      #    file.closed?  #=> false
      #  }
      #  # The file is now closed. See IF::GrandeStream#rio for more informatioin
      # 
      # ==== Why?
      #
      # Some of my favorite Rio idioms are its copy one-liners
      #
      #  rio('afile') < a_string # put a string into a file
      #  rio('afile') < an_array # put an array into a file
      #  rio('afile') < rio('anotherfile').lines(0..9) # copy the first 10 lines of anotherfile into afile
      #  rio('afile.gz').gzip < rio('anotherfile').lines(0..9) # same thing into a gzipped file
      #
      # In each of these cases, 'afile' would remain open after the copy and furthermore
      # since the destination Rio was not saved in a variable, There is no way to close file.
      # Without closeoncopy Something like this would be required:
      #
      #  ario = rio('afile')
      #  ario < something_else
      #  ario.close
      #
      # Or this...
      #
      #  ario = rio('afile') < something_else
      #  ario.close
      #
      # Or this...
      #
      #  (rio('afile') < something_else).close
      # One line, but ugly, and prone to error.
      #
      # What I want is this:
      #
      #  rio('afile') < something_else
      #
      # Simple. I want to copy this to that, I point the arrow and it works.
      #
      # In perl the rio's destructor would be called, because there are no remaining references to the Rio
      # However, it my understanding and experience that in Ruby the finalizer will not necessarily be 
      # called at this point.
