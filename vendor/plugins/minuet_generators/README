MinuetGenerators
================

These are a fairly simple set of generators which are designed to fulfill a few objectives:

* make it easy to build an admin system which has CRUD actions in the "admin" namespace but 
  only an index and show action in the normal namespace   
* make it easy to generate blank engines
* make it easy to generate an admin system inside the generated engines


Admin System Example
====================

These generators work pretty much like the regular Rails generators.  To make a new admin scaffold
for an Article resource, do this:

<tt>script/generate admin_scaffold Article title:string body:text</tt>

You should end up with index and show actions in the base namespace and a full admin system 
in the *admin* namespace, along with a working set of tests, routing taken care of for you, etc.


Engine Example
==============

<tt>script/generate engine Foo</tt>

This will generate a skeleton for a new Engine plugin, including the app folder and most of the
other stuff necessary to actually build a fresh engine. *Note*: the _engine_admin_scaffold_ generator
uses the <strong># engine routes go here</strong> declaration in the new plugin's routes.rb file, 
so don't get too tidy and erase that sucker if you want the convenience of automatic route mapping
when you generate your engine scaffolds.


Engine Admin System Example
===========================

Let's generate CRUD actions for an Article resource inside our Foo engine.

<tt>script/generate engine_admin_scaffold foo Article title:string body:text</tt>

This will generate the same stuff as the admin_scaffold generator above, except all the 
code generation will happen inside the Foo engine.

So, the basic pattern for this one is
<tt>script/generate engine_admin_scaffold engine_name ResourceName field:string</tt>


Installation
============

These generators are designed to work with Rails 2.1. You can get them here:

<tt>script/plugin install svn://labs.headlondon.com/minuet/trunk/minuet/vendor/plugins/minuet_generators</tt>

Keep in mind that you'll need to have the Rails 2.1 version of the Engines plugin installed
if you want any of the Engines functionality to work.
