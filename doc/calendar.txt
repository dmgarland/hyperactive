PUBLIC 

publish event
	--> title
	--> date/time
	--> place
	--> description

ability to repeat events
ability to upload files to go with an event (for posters, etc.)
	--> perhaps a flash-based poster designer?  could be cool

categorization scheme
	--> same categories as the corresponding Mir site
	--> publishing an event in a given category results in links to those category
	    newswires being generated in the event's display

ability to create logins for the calendar to develop trust
	--> some sort of key-signing system? maybe not necessary
	--> would require a confirmation email and a "click this link to activate your account"
	    type of thing

export of RSS feeds into mir to generate things like "event newswires"
	--> can use REST for this

comments on events? 
	--> maybe not, although this could be a good alternate way to get newswire posts into mir,
	--> could just have a "publish report" form on the calendar that would take all the info
	    from the form and dump it into Mir's newswire in the proper categories. Maybe easier 
	    than The Clara Solution.  


ADMIN
	--> categories manager
		--> contains the relevant part of the link to the corresponding newswire
		--> will need to look at Mir's URL schema to get this to work
		--> it could also be possible to make this work with other imc (or non-imc) systems

	--> content manager
		--> allows hiding of posts
		--> allows editing of posts
		--> could allow logged-in users to alter their own posts

	--> users manager
		--> create, delete, update users
	
	--> permissions system

MIR INTEGRATION
	--> publish form could link to calendar ("is this an event? click here")
	--> in a more complicated scenario, it should be possible to use one of the 
	    blank fields in the Mir publish form to insert the ID of the calendar event,
	    in order to tie a newswire posting to a calendar event.  This is probably for
	    stage 2 though.
