module RIO

      #def dir() target.dir end
      
      # Puts a Rio in YAML mode.
      #
      #
      # Rio uses the YAML class from the Ruby standard library to provide
      # support for reading and writing YAML files. Normally using
      # <tt>(skip)records</tt> is identical to <tt>(skip)lines</tt> because
      # while +records+ only selects and does not specify the record-type,
      # +lines+ is the default.
      #
      # The YAML extension distingishes between items selected using
      # IF::GrandeStream#records, IF::GrandeStream#rows and IF::GrandeStream#lines. 
      # Rio returns objects loaded via
      # YAML#load when +records+ or #objects is used; returns the YAML text as a String
      # when +rows+ or #documents is used; and returns lines as Strings as normal when
      # +lines+ is used.  +records+ is the default. 
      #
      # To read a single YAML document, Rio provides #getobj and #load. For
      # example, consider the following partial 'database.yml' from the rails
      # distribution:
      #
      #  development:
      #    adapter: mysql
      #    database: rails_development
      #
      #  test:
      #    adapter: mysql
      #    database: rails_test
      #
      #
      # To get the object represented in the yaml file:
      #
      #  rio('database.yml').yaml.load
      #     ==>{"development"=>{"adapter"=>"mysql", "database"=>"rails_development"}, 
      #         "test"=>{"adapter"=>"mysql", "database"=>"rails_test"}}
      #
      # Or one could read parts of the file like so:
      #
      #  rio('database.yml').yaml.getobj['development']['database']
      #     ==>"rails_development"
      #
      # Single objects can be written using #putobj and #putobj!
      # which is aliased to #dump
      #
      #  anobject = {
      #    'production' => {
      #      'adapter' => 'mysql',
      #      'database' => 'rails_production',
      #    }
      #  }
      #  rio('afile.yaml').yaml.dump(anobject)
      #
      #
      # Single objects can be written using IF::GrandeStream#putrec (aliased to IF::YAML#putobj
      # and IF::YAML#dump)
      #
      #  rio('afile.yaml').yaml.putobj(anobject)
      #
      # Single objects can be loaded using IF::GrandeStream#getrec (aliased to IF::YAML#getobj
      # and IF::YAML#load)
      #
      #  anobject = rio('afile.yaml').yaml.getobj
      #
      # A Rio in yaml-mode is just
      # like any other Rio. And all the things you can do with any Rio come
      # for free.  They can be iterated over using IF::Grande#each and read into an
      # array using IF::Grande#[] just like any other Rio. All the selection criteria
      # are identical also.
      #
      # Get the first three objects into an array:
      #
      #  array_of_objects = rio('afile.yaml').yaml[0..2]
      #
      # Iterate over only YAML documents that are a kind_of ::Hash:
      #
      #  rio('afile.yaml').yaml(::Hash) {|ahash| ...} 
      #
      # This takes advantage of the fact that the default for matching records
      # is <tt>===</tt>
      #
      # Selecting records using a Proc can be used as normal:
      #
      #  anarray = rio('afile.yaml').yaml(proc{|anobject| ...}).to_a
      #
      # One could even use the copy operator to convert a CSV file to a YAML
      # representation of the same data:
      #
      #  rio('afile.yaml').yaml < rio('afile.csv').csv 
      #
