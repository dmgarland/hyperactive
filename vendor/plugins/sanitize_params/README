sanitize_params
==============

A small plugin that puts Rick Olsen's white_list (http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/white_list/) plugin to good use. Sanitize_params crawls through whatever params are coming in through the current request and, you know, sanitizes them.

This is very much an option that covers all possible bases (and possibly more than is necessary), but it has been working well for us.

It began life in the CrowdVine app proper, written by Tony Stubblebine (http://www.stubbleblog.com/index.php/2007/06/rails-xss-filte/). Jodi Showers (http://nnovation.ca/) turned it into a plugin. Jay Laney is the maintainer.

We've been running it on Rails Edge, but it should work fine with 1.2.x.

Installation
============

You'll need the white_list plugin installed.

$ script/plugin install http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/white_list/

Also, this plugin.

$ script/plugin install http://sanitizeparams.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sanitize_params/

We want to make sure that white_list loads first, so in environment.rb:

config.plugins = [:white_list, :sanitize_params, :all]

And in application.rb:

before_filter :sanitize_params

And that's it.
