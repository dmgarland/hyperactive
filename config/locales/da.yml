	<p>Whenever someone uploads a video, our server keeps a full-quality copy of it so that you can 
	download it for screenings.  However, we do not currently have the capacity to serve these big files 
	ourselves.  Instead, we offer a download via Bittorrent, a peer-to-peer filesharing sytem.</p> 
	<p>In order to download the full-quality video, you will need to have some software installed on your computer.
	Basically you have two choices:
	<ul>
		<li>Bittorrent + VLC</li>
		<li>Miro</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Bittorrent + VLC</h2>
        <a href='http://www.bittorrent.com/download'>Bittorrent software</a> shares 
	the file you are downloading with other people as you download it.  If you want to help us distribute 
	video files, please leave your Bittorrent client open after your download finishes and you'll be donating
	your bandwidth and making everyone's downloads faster.</p>
	
	<p>All of the full-quality video has been converted into a free format called Ogg Theora.  The easiest way 
	to watch them is to use the excellent <a href='http://www.videolan.org/vlc/'>VLC</a> video player which
	you can <a href='http://www.videolan.org/vlc/'>download here</a>. Alternatively, you may download the
        <a href='http://xiph.org/quicktime/'>Ogg plugin for Quicktime</a>, or
        <a href='http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/'>Ogg plugin for Windows Media Player</a>. </p>
