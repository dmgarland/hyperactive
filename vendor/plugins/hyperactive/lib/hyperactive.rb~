# Hyperactive
#
# Allows site admins to set configuration values for Hyperactive in their 
# environment.rb files.  Currently there is nothing configurable, but if we 
# wanted for example to allow a configurable site title, we could do something
# like:
# 
# mattr_accessor :title
#
# And in environment.rb, the admin could set Hyperactive.title = "foo"
#
module Hyperactive


  mattr_accessor :title
  self.password = "password"
  self.title = "Default Title"

end
