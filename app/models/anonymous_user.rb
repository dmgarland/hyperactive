# The AnonymousUser class is a mock version of the User class. It provides
# the functionality that is relevant for the places where you do not need
# a logged in user but do not want to differentiate between "no user"
# and "a logged in user".
#
# This means, for example, that you can check for an AnonymousUser to have
# a certain role, group and also access its login and email. However, you
# cannot set any value of it through its instances.
#
# The AnonymousUser class implements the singleton pattern. Use AnonymousUser.instance
# to retrive the Singleton instance.
# The method "current_user" of the ApplicationControllerMixin and the RbacHelper
# will return the currently logged in user or the anonymous user when called.
# They will never return nil.
#
# You can configure the AnonymousUser instance by setting the :anonymous_user
# configuration value. For example, you could have the following in your
# <em>environment.rb</em>:
#
# <pre>
# module ActiveRbacConfig
#   config :anonymous_user_login, 'Anonymous User'
#   config :anonymous_user_email, 'nobody@localhost'
#   config :anonymous_user_roles,  [ 'Nobody' ]
#   config :anonymous_user_groups, [ 'Everybody' ]
# end
# </pre>
#
# You can set the following configuration settings:
#
# <dl>
#   <dt>:anonymous_user_login</dt>
#   <dd>The login value for the anonymous user.</dd>
#
#   <dt>:anonymous_user_email</dt>
#   <dd>The email adress to assume for the anonymous user.</dd>
#
#   <dt>:anonymous_user_roles, :anonymous_user_groups</dt>
#   <dd>The roles and groups the anonymous user has. You have to
#       specify the role's/group's "title" value.</dd>
# </dl>
#
# The existance of the AnonymousUser class makes many things simpler. For
# example, you can write the following in your templates
#
# <pre>
#   <% if current_user.has_role?('Admin') %>Hello, Admin<% end %>
# </pre>
#
# instead of
#
# <pre>
#  <% if !current_user.nil? and current_user.has_role?('Admin') %>Hello, 
#  Admin<% end %>
# </pre>
#
# The same is true for your controllers.
