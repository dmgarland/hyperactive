*SVN*

* Removed deprecated calls except of paginate, which is still used.
* Changed naming of some files to fit to the more strict routing in Rails 1.2
* Changed config part to confirm to engines 1.2. See README for further details

*0.4.1*

* Fixing the "delete.rhtml" template which was referencing the nonexisting action "destroy" instead of "delete" (#147, #177)
* LoginController#logout sets @active_rbac_user to nil (#153)
* The "leave empty to keep passwords unchanged" message in the User form is now only displayed when editing and existing user (#137).
* Performed the following renaming/merging in StaticPermissionController, RoleController, GroupController and UserController: new => create, edit => update, destroy => delete and adjusted tests (#101)
* Removed User.anonymous_user and added the AnonymousUser class instead. This class implements the Singleton pattern and you can get the global instance by using AnonymousUser.instance (#76)
* Fixed a bug in User.has_role? - User.has_role will now always return a boolean (#131)
* Errorneous calls to ActiveRecord::Base.save have been replaced by save! which means that if things go really wrong then an Exception will be thrown. In most cases this was unnecessary, though since save is in an alternative (if) anyway and thus checked. (#127)
* session[:rbac_user] does not exist any longer. Instead, the current user's id is written to session[:rbac_user_id]. Do not use these session variables, use ActiveRbacMixins::ApplicationControllerMixin and RbacHelper to get the current user with the "current_user" method provided by those two mixins instead (#87)
* Adding ActiveRbacMixins::ApplicationControllerMixin which provides the "current_user" method and is to be mixed into ApplicationController (#87)
* ActiveRBAC will not use flash[:notice] any more. flash[:warning] and flash[:error] are used instead. ActiveRBAC will also use flash[:success] (#129).
* Fixing a problem related to including 'exceptions.rb' two times. (#126)
* Adding ActiveRbac::MyAccountController which currently only provides an action to change the current user's password. Changing the password will set his state back to "confirmed" form "retrieved_password". Note that you still have to force the user to go to this page and change his password after he has retrieved it.
* Allowing login with "retrieved_password" state. (#50)
* Added "retrieved_password" state to User.default_states and adjusted all comparisons which this value all through ActiveRBAC (#50)
* Renamed User.has_role to User.has_role?, User.has_permission to User.has_permission? (#97)
* Cut out some of the validation of the User/Role/GroupMixin into User/Role/GroupMixin::Validation. The rest is in User/Role/GroupMixin::Core (#120)
* Added "new_password?" method to User class

*0.3.2.*

* Renaming app/model to app/models

*0.3.1*

* The RDOC documentation now only contains the API reference. The manual is available as a PDF at https://activerbac.turingstudio.com/releases/ActiveRbacManual.pdf (#121)
* Fixed the namespace problem of controllers & models (#119)
* Fixed a problem with the "railfix" code in Rails 1.1 (#114)
* ActiveRBAC now runs with Rails 1.1 (tested with 1.1.2) (#118)
* The files in app/model become stubs which simply import the ActiveRBAC mixins. This should make extending Models in your own code easier. (#112)
* Moving the constants User::DEFAULT_PASSWORD_HASH_TYPES and User::DEFAULT_STATES to private class methods with lowercased names. (CHECK FOR DEPENDENCY IN YOUR CODE)
* Renaming the "redirect_to" parameter/session variable nam of LoginController to "return_to" (#103)
* Adding "all_static_permissions" method to User. (#109)
* Adding Version identifier as described in http://api.rails-engines.org/engines/classes/Engine.html (#104)
* Removing 3 lines from user_controller.rb that expected InvalidStateTransition to be thrown (#113)
* adding support for redirect_to feature to LoginController (#100)
* Adding migration for schema import
* fixing a documentation issue (#94)

*0.3*

* Moving configuration into the "ActiveRbacConfig" module as is normal for engines.
* Controllers have been moved into a subdirectory "active_rbac" so they can be in the namespace "ActiveRbac"
* The structure of ActiveRBAC has been changed to the of an engine.

*0.2.2*

* The User controller did not allow to create a user with multiple assigned roles and / or groups; fixing this (#85)
* Fixing broken unit tests (#84, #85)
* Prefixing the functional tests for UserController that test the nonexisting preview action with "DEACTIVATED" to stop them from causing test failures (#83)
* Adding tests for #75

*0.2.1*

* Fixing documentation error (#81)
* Fixing documentation of the ImportCmsSchema migration (#67)

*0.2*

* Adding "salt" to the user table and passwords are salted now.
* Changing fixtures to use "--- !omap" instead of "--- !!omap" which seems to make them workw ith 0.14.2 RoR.
* Fixing a bug related to custom "parent=" methods in Role and Group.
* Making active_rbac compatible to RoR 0.14.2 (1.0RC3)
* Adding ComponentController that solves the "configuration vanishes after reload" issue and makes configuration handling more consistent.
* Merged the GET/POST differentiation of RegistrationController and LoginController. The actions available are now: login, logout for LoginController and register, lostpassword and confirm for RegistrationController.
* Using Unicode explicitely in the creation SQL scripts for MySQL now.
* We are using transactional fixtures now.
* Renamed UserTest in user_registration_test.rb to UserRegistrationTest.rb. "rake test_components" works now properly.
* Adding HOWTO: How To Allow User Login With Other States
* Developers can now override User.state_allows_login?(state) to implement their own login logic.
* Adding HOWTO: How To Change The State Workflow
* Adding HOWTO: How To Add Fields To The Registration Form
* Adding HOWTO file
* Adding support for additional fields to the configuration class.
* Moving constant User::STATES.states to the method User.states
