= Rio - Ruby I/O Facilitator

Rio is a facade for most of the standard ruby classes that deal with I/O;
providing a simple, intuitive, succinct interface to the functionality
provided by IO, File, Dir, Pathname, FileUtils, Tempfile, StringIO, OpenURI
and others. Rio also provides an application level interface which allows many
common I/O idioms to be expressed succinctly.


Rio functionality can be broadly broken into three categories
* path manipulation
* file system access
* stream manipulation

Which methods are available to a given Rio, depends on the underlying
object.

A Rio generally does not need to be opened or have its mode specified.
Most of Rio's methods simply configure it.  When an actual IO
operation is specified, Rio determines how to open it based on the
object it is opening, the operation it is performing, and the options
specified.

Rio configuration methods return the Rio for easy chaining and regard
the presence of a block as an implied +each+.

== Using a Rio

Using a Rio can be described as having 3 steps:
* Creating a Rio
* Configuring a Rio 
* Rio I/O

=== Creating a Rio

Rio extends Kernel with one function +rio+, its constructor. This
function is overloaded to create any type of Rio. +rio+ looks at the
class and sometimes the value of its first argument to create an
internal representation of the resource specified, additional
arguments are used as needed by the resource type. The rio constructor
does not initiate any io, it does not check for a resources existance
or type. It neither knows nor cares what can be done with this Rio.
Using methods like <tt>respond_to?</tt> are meaningless at best and usually
misleading.

For purposes of discussion, we divide Rios into two catagories, those
that have a path and those that don't.

==== Creating a Rio that has a path

To create a Rio that has a path the arguments to +rio+ may be:

* a string representing the entire path. The separator used for Rios
  is as specified in RFC1738 ('/').

   rio('adir/afile')

* a string representing a fully qualified +file+ URI as per RFC1738

   rio('file:///atopleveldir/adir/afile')

* a +URI+ object representing a +file+ or generic +URI+

   rio(URI('adir/afile'))

* the components of a path as separate arguments

   rio('adir','afile')

* the components of a path as an array

   rio(%w/adir afile/)

* another Rio

   another_rio = rio('adir/afile')
   rio(another_rio)

* any object whose +to_s+ method returns one of the above

   rio(Pathname.new('apath'))

* any combination of the above either as separate arguments or as
  elements of an array,

   another_rio = rio('dir1/dir2')
   auri = URI('dir4/dir5)
   rio(another_rio,'dir3',auri,'dir6/dir7')

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a web page

To create a Rio that refers to a web page the arguments to +rio+ may
be:

* a string representing a fully qualified +http+ URI

   rio('http://ruby-doc.org/index.html')

* a +URI+ object representing a +http+ +URI+

   rio(URI('http://ruby-doc.org/index.html'))

* either of the above with additional path elements

   rio('http://www.ruby-doc.org/','core','classes/Object.html')
   

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a file or directory on a FTP server

To create a Rio that refers to a file on a FTP server the arguments to
+rio+ may be:

* a string representing a fully qualified +ftp+ URI

   rio('ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com/afile.tar.gz')

* a +URI+ object representing a +ftp+ +URI+

   rio(URI('ftp://ftp.example.com/afile.tar.gz'))

* either of the above with additional path elements

   rio('ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu','emacs','windows','README')
   
==== Creating Rios that do not have a path

To create a Rio without a path, the first argument to +rio+ is usually
a single character.

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a clone of your programs stdin or stdout.

<tt>rio(?-)</tt> (mnemonic: '-' is used by some Unix programs to
specify stdin or stdout in place of a file)

Just as a Rio that refers to a file, does not know whether that file
will be opened for reading or writing until an io operation is
specified, a <tt>stdio:</tt> Rio does not know whether it will connect
to stdin or stdout until an I/O operation is specified.

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a clone of your programs stderr.

<tt>rio(?=)</tt> (mnemonic: '-' refers to fileno 1, so '=' refers to
fileno 2)

===== Creating a Rio that refers to an arbitrary IO object.

 an_io = ::File.new('afile')
 rio(an_io)

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a file descriptor

<tt>rio(?#,fd)</tt> (mnemonic: a file descriptor is a number '#' )

 an_io = ::File.new('afile')
 rio(an_io)

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a StringIO object

<tt>rio(?")</tt> (mnemonic: '"' surrounds strings)
* create a Rio that refers to its own string
 rio(?")
* create a Rio that refers to a string of your choosing
 astring = ""
 rio(?",astring)

===== Creating a Rio that refers to a Temporary object

<tt>rio(??)</tt> (mnemonic: '?' you don't know its name)

To create a temporary object that will become a file
or a directory, depending on how you use it:
 rio(??)
 rio(??,basename='rio',tmpdir=Dir::tmpdir)

To force it to become a directory:
 rio(??).mkdir
or
 rio(??).chdir



===== Creating a Rio that refers to an arbitrary TCPSocket

 rio('tcp:',hostname,port)
or
 rio('tcp://hostname:port')

===== Creating a Rio that runs an external program and connects to its stdin and stdout

<tt>rio(?-,cmd)</tt> (mnemonic: '-' is used by some Unix programs to
specify stdin or stdout in place of a file)

or

<tt>rio(?`,cmd)</tt> (mnemonic: '`' (backtick) runs an external
program in ruby)

This is Rio's interface to IO#popen

=== Path Manipulation

Rio's path manipulation methods are for the most part simply forwarded
to the File or URI classes with the return values converted to a Rio.

==== Creating a Rio from a Rio's component parts.

The Rio methods for creating a Rio from a Rio's component parts are
IF::Path#dirname, IF::Path#filename, IF::Path#basename, and IF::Path#extname.  The
behavior of IF::Path#basename depends on the setting of the +ext+
configuration variable and is different from its counterpart in the
File class. The default value of the +ext+ configuration variable is
the string returned File#extname. The +ext+ configuration variable can
be changed using IF::Path#ext and IF::Path#noext and can be queried using
IF::Path#ext?. This value is used by calls to IF::Path#basename.

IF::Path#filename returns the last component of a path, and is basically
the same as +basename+ without consideration of an extension.

   rio('afile.txt').basename       #=> rio('afile')
   rio('afile.txt').filename       #=> rio('afile.txt')

   ario = rio('afile.tar.gz')
   ario.basename                   #=> rio('afile.tar')
   ario.ext?                       #=> ".gz"
   ario.ext('.tar.gz').basename    #=> rio('afile')
   ario.ext?                       #=> ".tar.gz"

==== Changing a path's component parts.

Rio also provides methods for changing the component parts of its
path.  They are IF::Path#dirname=, IF::Path#filename=, IF::Path#basename=, and
IF::Path#extname=. These methods replace the part extracted as described
above with their argument.

   ario = rio('dirA/dirB/afile.rb')
   ario.dirname = 'dirC'          # rio('dirC/afile.rb')
   ario.basename = 'bfile'        # rio('dirC/bfile.rb')
   ario.extname = '.txt'          # rio('dirC/bfile.txt')
   ario.filename = 'cfile.rb'     # rio('dirC/cfile.rb')

Rio also has a +rename+ mode which causes each of these to rename the
actual file system object as well as changing the Rio. This is
discussed in the section on Renaming and Moving.

==== Splitting a Rio

IF::Grande#split (or IF::Path#splitpath) returns an array of Rios, one 
for each path element. (Note that this behavior differs from File#split.)

   rio('a/b/c').split   #=> [rio('a'),rio('b'),rio('c')]

The array returned is extended with a +to_rio+ method, which will put
the parts back together again.

   ary = rio('a/b/c').split   #=> [rio('a'),rio('b'),rio('c')]
   ary.to_rio           #=> rio('a/b/c')

==== Creating a Rio by specifying the individual parts of its path

The first way to create a Rio by specifying its parts is to use the
Rio constructor Rio#rio. Since a Rio is among the arguments the
constructor will take, the constructor can be used.

   ario = rio('adir')
   rio(ario,'b')    #=> rio('adir/b')

IF::Path#join and IF::Path#/ do the same thing, but the operator version
<tt>/</tt> can take only one argument.

   a = rio('a')
   b = rio('b')
   c = a.join(b)    #=> rio('a/b')
   c = a/b          #=> rio('a/b')

The arguments to IF::Path#join and IF::Path#/ do not need to be Rios, of course
   ario = rio('adir')
   ario/'afile.rb'           #=> rio('adir/afile.rb')
   ario.join('b','c','d')    #=> rio('adir/b/c/d')
   ario/'b'/'c'/'d'          #=> rio('adir/b/c/d')
   ario /= 'e'               #=> rio('adir/b/c/d/e')

==== Manipulating a Rio path by treating it as a string.

The Rio methods which treat a Rio as a string are IF::String#sub, IF::String#gsub
and IF::String#+.  These methods create a new Rio using the string created by
forwarding the method to the String returned by Rio#to_s.

   ario = rio('dirA/dirB/afile') + '-1.1.1'   # rio('dirA/dirB/afile-1.1.1')
   brio = ario.sub(/^dirA/, 'dirC')           # rio('dirC/dirB/afile-1.1.1')                         
                            

==== Creating a Rio based on its relationship to another

IF::Path#abs creates a new rio whose path is the absolute path of a Rio.
If called with an argument, it uses it as the base path, otherwise
it uses an internal base path (usually the current working directory
when it was created).

   rio('/tmp').chdir do
     rio('a').abs            #=> rio('/tmp/a')
     rio('a').abs('/usr')    #=> rio('/usr/a')
   end

IF::Path#rel creates a new rio with a path relative to a Rio.

   rio('/tmp').chdir do
     rio('/tmp/a').rel       #=> rio('a')
   end
   rio('/tmp/b').rel('/tmp') #=> rio('b')

IF::Path#route_to and IF::Path#route_from creates a new rio with a path
representing the route to get to/from a Rio. They are based on the
methods of the same names in the ::URI class

=== Configuring a Rio

The second step in using a rio is configuring it. Note that many times
no configuration is necessary and that this is not a comprehensive
list of all of Rio's configuration methods.

Rio's configuration mehods fall into three categories.

* I/O manipulators

  An I/O manipulator alters the behavior of a Rio's underlying IO
  object. These affect the behaviour of I/O methods which are
  forwarded directly to the underlying object as well as the grande
  I/O methods.

* Grande configuration methods

  The grande configuration methods affect the behaviour of Rio's
  grande I/O methods

* Grande selection methods

  The grande selection methods select what data is returned by Rio's
  grande I/O methods

All of Rio's configuration and selection methods can be passed a
block, which will cause the Rio to behave as if IF::Grande#each had been called
with the block after the method.

==== IO manipulators

* +gzip+ a file on output, and ungzip it on input

   rio('afile.gz').gzip

  This causes the rio to read through a Zlib::GzipReader and to write
  Zlib::GzipWriter.

* +chomp+ lines as they are read

   rio('afile').chomp

  This causes a Rio to call String#chomp on the the String returned by
  all line oriented read operations.

==== Grande configuration methods

* +all+, +recurse+, +norecurse+

   rio('adir').all
   rio('adir').norecurse('CVS')

  These methods instruct the Rio to also include entries in
  subdirectories when iterating through directories and control which
  subdirectories are included or excluded.

* +bytes+

   rio('afile').bytes(1024)

  This causes a Rio to read the specified number of bytes at a time as
  a file is iterated through.

==== Grande selection methods

* +lines+, +skiplines+

   rio('afile').lines(0..9)
   rio('afile').skiplines(/^\s*#/)

  Strictly speaking these are both configuration and selection
  methods. They configure the Rio to iterate through an input stream
  as lines. The arguments select which lines are actually returned.
  Lines are included (+lines+) or excluded (+skiplines+) if they match
  *any* of the arguments as follows.

  If the argument is a:
  +RegExp+::  the line is matched against it
  +Range+::   the lineno is matched against it
  +Integer+:: the lineno is matched against it as if it were a one element range
  +Symbol+::  the symbol is +sent+ to the string; the line is included unless it returns false
  +Proc+::    the proc is called with the line as an argument; the line is included unless it returns false
  +Array+::   an array containing any of the above, all of which must match for the line to be included

* +entries+, +files+, +dirs+, +skipentries+, +skipfiles+, +skipdirs+

   rio('adir').files('*.txt')
   rio('adir').skipfiles(/^\./)

  These methods select which entries will be returned when iterating
  throug directories.  Entries are included (+entries+,+files+,+dirs+)
  or excluded(+skipentries+,+skipfiles+,+skipdirs+) if they match *any* of
  the arguments as follows.

  If the argument is a:
  +String+:: the arg is treated as a glob; the filname is matched against it
  +RegExp+:: the filname is matched against it
  +Symbol+:: the symbol is +sent+ to the entry (a Rio); the entry is included unless it returns false
  +Proc+:: the proc is called with the entry (a Rio) as an argument; the entry is included unless it returns false
  +Array+::   an array containing any of the above, all of which must match for the line to be included

* +records+, +rows+, +skiprecords+, +skiprows+

   rio('afile').bytes(1024).records(0...10)

  These select items from an input stream just as +lines+, but without
  specifying lines as the input record type. They can be used to
  select different record types in extension modules. The only such
  module at this writing is the CSV extension. In that case +records+
  causes each line of a CSV file to be parsed into an array while
  +lines+ causes each line of the file to be returned normally.

=== Rio I/O

As stated above the the three steps to using a Rio are:
* Creating a Rio
* Configuring a Rio
* Doing I/O

This section describes that final step.

After creating and configuring a Rio, the file-system has not been
accessed, no socket has been opened, not so much as a test for a files
existance has been done. When an I/O method is called on a Rio, the
sequence of events required to complete that operation on the
underlying object takes place. Rio takes care of creating the
appropriate object (eg IO,Dir), opening the object with the appropriate
mode, performing the operation, closing the object if required, and
returning the results of the operation.

Rio's I/O operations can be divide into two catagories:
* Proxy operations
* Grande operations

==== Proxy operations
  
These are calls which are forwarded to the underlying object (eg
IO,Dir,Net::FTP), after appropriately creating and configuring that
object. The result produced by the method is returned, and the object
is closed.

In some cases the result is modified before being returned, as when a
Rio is configured with IF::GrandeStream#chomp.

In all cases, if the result returned by the underlying object, could
itself be used for further I/O operations it is returned as a Rio. For
example: where File#dirname returns a string, IF::Path#dirname returns a
Rio; where Dir#read returns a string representing a directory entry,
IF::FileOrDir#read returns a Rio.

With some noteable exceptions, most of the operations available if one
were using the underlying Ruby I/O class are available to the Rio and
will behave identically.

For things that exist on a file system:

* All the methods in FileTest are available as Rio instance
  methods. For example

   FileTest.file?('afile')

  becomes

   rio('afile').file?

* All the instance methods of +File+ except +path+ are available to a
  rio without change

* Most of the class methods of +File+ are available. 

  * For those that take a filename as their only argument the calls
    are mapped to Rio instance methods as described above for
    FileTest.

  * +dirname+, and +readlink+ return Rios instead of strings

  * Rio has its own IF::Path#basename, IF::Path#join and IF::FileOrDir#symlink, which
    provide similar functionality.

  * The class methods which take multiple filenames
    (+chmod+,+chown+,+lchmod+,+lchown+) are available as Rio instance
    methods. For example

     File.chmod(0666,'afile')
    becomes
     rio('afile').chmod(06660)

For I/O Streams

Most of the instance methods of IO are available, and most do the same
thing, with some interface changes.  <b>The big exception to this is
the '<<' operator.</b> This is one of Rio's grande operators. While
the symantics one would use to write to an IO object would actually
accomplish the same thing with a Rio, It is a very different
operator. Read the section on grande operators. The other differences
between IO instance methods and the Rio equivelence can be summarized
as follows.

* The simple instance methods (eg +fcntl+, <tt>eof?</tt>,
  <tt>tty?</tt> etc.)  are forwarded and the result returned as is

* Anywhere IO returns an IO, Rio returns a Rio

* +close+ and its cousins return the Rio. 

* +each_byte+ and +each_line+ are forwarded as is.

* All methods which read (read*,get*,each*) will cause the file to
  closed when the end of file is reached.  This behavior is
  configurable, but the default is to close on eof

* The methods which write (put*,print*) are forwarded as is; put* and
  print* return the Rio; write returns the value returned by IO#write;
  as mentioned above '<<' is a grande operator in Rio.

For directories:

* all the instance methods of Dir are available except +each+ which is
  a grande method.

* the class methods +mkdir+, +delete+, +rmdir+ are provided as
  instance methods.

* +chdir+ is provided as an instance method. IF::Dir#chdir returns a Rio
  and passes a Rio to a block if one is provided.

* +glob+ is provided as an instance method, but returns an array of
  Rios

* +foreach+ is not supported

* +each+ and <tt>[]</tt> have similar functionality provided by Rio


For other Rios, instance methods are generally forwarded where
appropriate. For example

* Rios that refer to StringIO objects forward 'string' and 'string='

* Rios that refer to http URIs support all the Meta methods provided
  by open-uri

  
==== Grande operators

The primary grande operator is IF::Grande#each. +each+ is used to iterate
through Rios. When applied to a file it iterates through records in
the file. When applied to a directory it iterates through the entries
in the directory. Its behavior is modified by configuring the Rio
prior to calling it using the configuration methods discussed
above. Since iterating through things is ubiquitous in ruby, it is
implied by the presence of a block after any of the grande
configuration methods and many times does not need to be call
explicitly. For example:

 # iterate through chomped ruby comment lines
 rio('afile.rb').chomp.lines(/^\s*#/) { |line| ... } 
 
 # iterate through all .rb files in 'adir' and its subdirectories
 rio('adir').all.files('*.rb') { |f| ... } 

Because a Rio is an Enumerable, it supports +to_a+, which is the basis
for the grande subscript operator.  IF::Grande#[] with no arguments simply
calls to_a. With arguments it behaves as if those arguments had been
passed to the most recently called of the grande selection methods
listed above, and then calls to_a. For example to get the first ten
lines of a file into an array with lines chomped

 rio('afile').chomp.lines(0...10).to_a

can be written as

 rio('afile.gz').chomp.lines[0...10]

or, to create an array of all the .c files in a directory, one could
write

 rio('adir').files['*.c']

The other grande operators are its copy operators. They are:

* <tt><</tt> (copy-from)

* <tt><<</tt> (append-from)

* <tt>></tt> (copy-to)

* <tt>>></tt> (append-to)

The only difference between the 'copy' and 'append' versions is how
they deal with an unopened resource.  In the former the open it with
mode 'w' and in the latter, mode 'a'.  Beyond that, their behavior can
be summarized as:

   source.each do |entry|
     destination << entry
   end

Since they are based on the +each+ operator, all of the selection and
configuration options are available.  And the right-hand-side argument
of the operators are not restricted to Rios -- Strings and Arrays are
also supported.

For example:

 rio('afile') > astring # copy a file into a string

 rio('afile').chomp > anarray # copy the chomped lines of afile into an array

 rio('afile.gz').gzip.lines(0...100) > rio('bfile') # copy 100 lines from a gzipped file into another file

 rio(?-) < rio('http://rubydoc.org/') # copy a web page to stdout

 rio('bdir') < rio('adir') # copy an entire directory structure

 rio('adir').dirs.files('README') > rio('bdir') # same thing, but only README files

 rio(?-,'ps -a').skiplines(0,/ps$/) > anarray # copy the output of th ps command into an array, skippying
                                            # the header line and the ps command entry

=== Renaming and Moving

Rio provides two methods for directly renaming objects on the
filesystem: IF::FileOrDir#rename and IF::FileOrDir#rename!. 
Both of these use File#rename. 
The difference between them is the returned Rio. 
IF::FileOrDir#rename leaves the path of the Rio unchanged, 
while IF::FileOrDir#rename! changes the path of the Rio to refer 
to the renamed path.

   ario = rio('a')
   ario.rename('b')  # file 'a' has been renamed to 'b' but 'ario' => rio('a')
   ario.rename!('b')  # file 'a' has been renamed to 'b' and 'ario' => rio('b')

Rio also has a +rename+ mode, which causes the path manipulation
methods IF::Path#dirname=, IF::Path#filename=, IF::Path#basename= and
IF::Path#extname= to rename an object on the filesystem when they are
used to change a Rio's path. A Rio is put in +rename+ mode by calling
IF::FileOrDir#rename with no arguments.

   rio('adir/afile.txt').rename.filename = 'bfile.rb' # adir/afile.txt => adir/bfile.rb
   rio('adir/afile.txt').rename.basename = 'bfile'    # adir/afile.txt => adir/bfile.txt
   rio('adir/afile.txt').rename.extname  = '.rb'      # adir/afile.txt => adir/afile.rb
   rio('adir/afile.txt').rename.dirname =  'b/c'      # adir/afile.txt => b/c/afile.txt

When +rename+ mode is set for a directory Rio, it is automatically set
in the Rios created when iterating through that directory.

   rio('adir').rename.files('*.htm') do |frio|
      frio.extname = '.html'  #=> changes the rio and renames the file
   end

=== Deleting 

The Rio methods for deleting filesystem objects are IF::File#rm, IF::Dir#rmdir,
IF::Dir#rmtree, IF::Grande#delete, and IF::Grande#delete!. +rm+, +rmdir+ and +rmtree+
are passed the like named methods in the FileUtils module. IF::Grande#delete
calls +rmdir+ for directories and +rm+ for anything else, while
IF::Grande#delete!  calls IF::Dir#rmtree for directories.

* To delete something only if it is not a directory use IF::File#rm
* To delete an empty directory use IF::Dir#rmdir
* To delete an entire directory tree use IF::Dir#rmtree
* To delete anything except a populated directory use IF::Grande#delete
* To delete anything use IF::Grande#delete!

It is not an error to call any of the deleting methods on something
that does not exist. Rio provides IF::Test#exist? and IF::Test#symlink? to check
if something exists (<tt>exist?</tt> returns false for symlinks to
non-existant object even though the symlink itself exists).  The
deleting methods' purpose is to make things not exist, so calling one
of them on something that already does not exist is considered a
success.

To create a clean copy of a directory whether or not anything with
that name exists one might do this

 rio('adir').delete!.mkpath.chdir do
   # do something in adir
 end

---

== Miscellany


==== Using Symbolic Links

To create a symbolic link (symlink) to the file-system entry refered
to by a Rio, use IF::FileOrDir#symlink.  IF::FileOrDir#symlink differs from File#symlink
in that it calculates the path from the symlink location to the Rio's
position.

 File#symlink('adir/afile','adir/alink')

creates a symlink in the directory 'adir' named 'alink' which
references 'adir/afile'. From the perspective of 'alink', 'adir/afile'
does not exist. While:

 rio('adir/afile').symlink('adir/alink')

creates a symlink in the directory 'adir' named 'alink' which
references 'afile'. This is the route to 'adir/afile' from the
perspective of 'adir/alink'.

Note that the return value from +symlink+ is the calling Rio and not a
Rio refering to the symlink.  This is done for consistency with the
rest of Rio.

IF::Test#symlink? can be used to test if a file-system object is a
symlink. A Rio is extended with IF::FileOrDir#readlink, and
IF::Test#lstat only if IF::Test#symlink? returns true. So for
non-symlinks, these will raise a NoMethodError. These are both passed
to their counterparts in File. IF::FileOrDir#readlink returns a Rio
refering to the result of File#readlink.


==== Using A Rio as an IO (or File or Dir)

Rio supports so much of IO's interface that one might be tempted to
pass it to a method that expects an IO. While Rio is not and is not
intended to be a stand in for IO, this can work.  It requires
knowledge of every IO method that will be called, under any
circumstances.

Even in cases where Rio supports the required IO interface, A Rio
feature that seems to cause the most incompatibility, is its automatic
closing of files. To turn off all of Rio's automatic closing use
IF::GrandeStream#noautoclose.

For example:
 require 'yaml'
 yrio = rio('ran.yaml').delete!.noautoclose
 YAML.dump( ['badger', 'elephant', 'tiger'], yrio )
 obj = YAML::load( yrio ) #=> ["badger", "tiger", "elephant"]


==== Automatically Closing Files

Rio closes files automatically in three instances. 

When reading from an IO it is closed when the end of file is
reached. While this is a reasonable thing to do in many cases,
sometimes this is not desired.  To turn Rio's automatic closing on end
of file use IF::GrandeStream#nocloseoneof (it can be turned back on via
IF::GrandeStream#closeoneof)

 ario = rio('afile').nocloseoneof
 lines = ario[]
 ario.closed?   #=> false

Closing on end-of-file is necessary for many of Rio's one-liners, but
has an implication that may be surprising at first. A Rio starts life
as a path, not much more than a string. When one of its read methods
is called it becomes an input stream. When the stream is closed, it
becomes a path again. This means that when reading from a Rio, the
end-of-file condition is seen only once before it becomes a path
again, and will be reopened if another read operation is attempted.

Another time a Rio will be closed atomatically is when writing to it
with one of the copy operators (<tt><, <<, >, >></tt>).  This behavior
can be turned off with IF::GrandeStream#nocloseoncopy.

To turn off both of thes types of automatic closing use
IF::GrandeStream#noautoclose.

The third instance when Rio will close a file automatically is when a
file opened for one type of access receives a method which that access
mode does not support.  So, the code 
 rio('afile').puts("Hello World").gets 
will open the file for write access when the +puts+
method is received. When +gets+ is called the file is closed and
reopened with read access.

==== Explicitly Closing Files

Rio can not determine when the client is finished writing to it, as it
does using +eof+ on read. It is the author's understanding that Ruby
does not support a mechanism to have code run when there are no more
references to it -- that finalizers are not necessarily run immediatly
upon an object's reference count reaching 0.  If this understanding is
incorrect, some of Rio's extranious ways of closing a file may be
rethought.

That being said, Rio support several ways to explicitly close a
file. IF::RubyIO#close will close any open Rio. 
The output methods 
IF::RubyIO#puts!, IF::RubyIO#putc!, IF::RubyIO#printf!, IF::RubyIO#print!, and IF::RubyIO#write!  
behave as if their
counterparts without the exclamation point had been called and then
call IF::RubyIO#close or IF::RubyIO#close_write if the underlying IO object is
opened for duplex access.


==== Open mode selection

A Rio is typically not explicitly opened. It opens a file
automatically when an input or output methed is called. For output
methods Rio opens a file with mode 'w', and otherwise opens a file
with mode 'r'. This behavior can be modified using the tersely named
methods IF::GrandeStream#a, IF::GrandeStream#a!, IF::GrandeStream#r, IF::GrandeStream#r!, IF::GrandeStream#w, and IF::GrandeStream#w!, which cause
the Rio to use modes 'a','a+','r','r+','w',and 'w+' respectively.

One way to append a string to a file and close it in one line is

 rio('afile').a.puts!("Hello World") 

Run a cmd that must be opened for read and write

 ans = rio(?-,'cat').w!.puts!("Hello Kitty").readline

The automatic selection of mode can be bypassed entirely using
IF::RubyIO#mode and IF::FileOrDir#open.

If a mode is specified using +mode+, the file will still be opened
automatically, but the mode specified in the +mode+ method will be
used regardless of whether it makes sense.

A Rio can also be opened explicitly using IF::FileOrDir#open. +open+ takes one
parameter, a mode.  This also will override all of Rio's automatic
mode selection.


==== CSV mode

Rio uses the CSV class from the Ruby standard library to provide
support for reading and writing comma-separated-value files. Normally
using <tt>(skip)records</tt> is identical to <tt>(skip)lines</tt> because
while +records+ only selects and does not specify the record-type,
+lines+ is the default.

 rio('afile').records(1..2)

effectively means

 rio('afile').lines.records(1..2)

The CSV extension distingishes between items selected using
IF::GrandeStream#records and those selected using IF::GrandeStream#lines. Rio returns records
parsed into Arrays by the CSV library when +records+ is used, and
returns Strings as normal when +lines+ is used.  +records+ is the
default.

 rio('f.csv').puts!(["h0,h1","f0,f1"])                 

 rio('f.csv').csv.records[]    #==>[["h0", "h1"], ["f0", "f1"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv[]            #==> same thing
 rio('f.csv').csv.lines[]      #==>["h0,h1\n", "f0,f1\n"]
 rio('f.csv').csv.records[0]   #==>[["h0", "h1"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv[0]           #==> same thing
 rio('f.csv').csv.lines[0]     #==>["h0,h1\n"]
 rio('f.csv').csv.skiprecords[0] #==>[["f0", "f1"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv.skiplines[0]   #==>["f0,f1\n"]

This distinction, of course, applies equally when using the copy
operators and +each+

 rio('f.csv').csv[0] > rio('out').csv # out contains "f0,f1\n"

 rio('f.csv').csv { |array_of_fields| ... }

Notice that +csv+ mode is called on both the input and output
Rios. The +csv+ on the 'out' Rio causes it to treat an array written
to it as an array of records which is converted into CSV format before
writing. Without the +csv+, the output would be written as if
Array#to_s on [["f0","f1"]] had been called 

 rio('f.csv').csv[0] > rio('out') # out contains "f0f1"

The String representing a record that is returned when using +lines+
is extended with a +to_a+ method which will parse it into an array of
fields. Likewise the Array returned when a record is returned using
+records+ is extended with a modified +to_s+ which treats it as an
array CSV fields, rather than just an array of strings.

 array_of_lines = rio('f.csv').csv.lines[1]      #==>["f0,f1\n"]
 array_of_records = rio('f.csv').csv.records[1]  #==>[["f0", "f1"]]

 array_of_lines[0].to_a                          #==>["f0", "f1"]
 array_of_records[0].to_s                        #==>"f0,f1"

IF::CSV#csv takes two optional parameters, which are passed on to the CSV
library. They are the +field_separator+ and the +record_separator+.

 rio('semisep').puts!(["h0;h1","f0;f1"])                 

 rio('semisep').csv(';').to_a  #==>[["h0", "h1"], ["f0", "f1"]]

These are specified independently on the source and destination when
using the copy operators.

 rio('semisep').csv(';') > rio('colonsep').csv(':')
 rio('colonsep').contents  #==>"h0:h1\nf0:f1\n"

Rio provides two methods for selecting fields from CSV records in a
manner similar to that provided for selecting lines -- IF::CSV#columns and
IF::CSV#skipcolumns.

 rio('f.csv').puts!(["h0,h1,h2,h3","f0,f1,f2,f3"])

 rio('f.csv').csv.columns(0).to_a       #==>[["h0"], ["f0"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv.skipcolumns(0).to_a     #==>[["h1", "h2", "h3"], ["f1", "f2", "f3"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv.columns(1..2).to_a    #==>[["h1", "h2"], ["f1", "f2"]]
 rio('f.csv').csv.skipcolumns(1..2).to_a  #==>[["h0", "h3"], ["f0", "f3"]]

IF::CSV#columns can, of course be used with the +each+ and the copy
operators:

 rio('f.csv').csv.columns(0..1) > rio('out').csv
 rio('out').contents  #==>"h0,h1\nf0,f1\n"


==== YAML mode

Rio uses the YAML class from the Ruby standard library to provide
support for reading and writing YAML files. Normally
using <tt>(skip)records</tt> is identical to <tt>(skip)lines</tt> because
while +records+ only selects and does not specify the record-type,
+lines+ is the default. 

The YAML extension distingishes between items selected using
IF::GrandeStream#records, IF::GrandeStream#rows and IF::GrandeStream#lines. Rio returns objects
loaded via YAML#load when +records+ is used; returns the YAML text
as a String when +rows+ is used; and
returns lines as Strings as normal when +lines+ is used.  
+records+ is the default. In yaml-mode, <tt>(skip)records</tt> can be called
as <tt>(skip)objects</tt> and <tt>(skip)rows</tt> can be called as
<tt>(skip)documents</tt>

To read a single YAML document, Rio provides #getobj and #load
For example, consider the following partial 'database.yml' from
the rails distribution:

 development:
   adapter: mysql
   database: rails_development

 test:
   adapter: mysql
   database: rails_test


To get the object represented in the yaml file:

 rio('database.yml').yaml.load
    ==>{"development"=>{"adapter"=>"mysql", "database"=>"rails_development"}, 
        "test"=>{"adapter"=>"mysql", "database"=>"rails_test"}}

Or one could read parts of the file like so:

 rio('database.yml').yaml.getobj['development']['database']
    ==>"rails_development"

Single objects can be written using #putobj and #putobj!
which is aliased to #dump

 anobject = {
   'production' => {
     'adapter' => 'mysql',
     'database' => 'rails_production',
   }
 }
 rio('afile.yaml').yaml.dump(anobject)


IF::Grande#> (copy-to) and IF::Grande#>> (append-to) will fill an array with with all selected
YAML documents in the Rio. For non-arrays, the yaml text is copied. (This may change
if a useful reasonable alternative can be found)
 
 rio('afile.yaml').yaml > anarray # load all YAML documents from 'afile.yaml'

Single objects can be written using IF::GrandeStream#putrec (aliased to IF::YAML#putobj and IF::YAML#dump)

 rio('afile.yaml').yaml.putobj(anobject)

Single objects can be loaded using IF::GrandeStream#getrec (aliase to IF::YAML#getobj and IF::YAML#load)

 anobject = rio('afile.yaml').yaml.getobj

A Rio in yaml-mode is just like any other Rio. And all the things you
can do with any Rio come for free.  They can be iterated over using
IF::Grande#each and read into an array using IF::Grande#[] just like
any other Rio. All the selection criteria are identical also.

Get the first three objects into an array:

 array_of_objects = rio('afile.yaml').yaml[0..2]

Iterate over only YAML documents that are a kind_of ::Hash use:

 rio('afile.yaml').yaml(::Hash) {|ahash| ...} 

This takes advantage of the fact that the default for matching records is <tt>===</tt>

Selecting records using a Proc can be used as normal:

 anarray = rio('afile.yaml').yaml(proc{|anobject| ...}).to_a
