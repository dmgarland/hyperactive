    module Grande

      # Returns the contents of the rio as an array. (See ::Enumerable#to_a)
      #
      # IF::Grande#to_a is implemented in terms of #each so the the following are roughly equivelent
      #
      #  ary = ario.to_a
      #
      #  ary = []
      #  ario.each do |rec|
      #    ary << ary
      #  end
      #
      # What constitutes an array element is determined by IF::GrandeStream#lines, 
      # IF::GrandeStream#bytes, IF::GrandeStream#records, IF::GrandeStream#rows or 
      # by an extension such as IF::CSV#csv. IF::GrandeStream#lines is the default.
      #
      #  rio('afile.txt').to_a # returns an array of the lines in afile.txt
      #
      #  rio('afile.txt').lines(1...3).to_a # an array containing lines 1 and 2 of afile.txt
      # 
      #  rio('afile.dat').bytes(50).to_a # an array containing the contents of afile.dat broken 
      #                                  # up into 50 byte chunks
      #
      # See also IF::Grande#[] (subscript operator)
      #
      def to_a() target.to_a() end

      # Grande subscript operator. 
      # 
      # For files this returns all or part of a file as an array.
      #
      # For directories this returns all or some of the entries in a directory
      #
      # === Files
      #
      # This combines the record selection offered by IF::GrandeStream#records with
      # the conversion to an array provided by IF::Grande#to_a. The following two are equivelant:
      #  ario[*args]
      #  ario.records(*args).to_a
      #
      # What constitutes an array element is determined by IF::GrandeStream#lines, IF::GrandeStream#bytes, 
      # or by an extension such as IF::CSV#csv. IF::GrandeStream#lines is the default.
      # 
      # Arguments may consist of zero or more integers, ranges, regular expressions, symbols,
      # procs, and arrays
      # An empty argument list selects all records
      #
      # Records are selected as follows.
      # range::   specifies a range of records to be selected (zero based)
      # regexp::  matching records will be selected.
      # integer:: treated like a one element range
      # symbol::  the symbol is sent to each record. Record is selected 
      #           unless false is returned
      # proc::    the proc is called with the record as an argument. 
      #           Record is selected unless false is returned
      # array::   the array may contain any of the other selector types. Record is selected
      #           unless any of the selectors returns false. (a logical and)
      # 
      # A record matching *any* of the selectors will be included in the array. (acts like an _or_)
      #
      # Because this is implemented in terms of the IF::Grande#each, 
      # When only record ranges are used to select records,
      # iteration will stop when the recno exceeds the maximum of any range. That is to say
      #
      # This reads one record from a file and returns it
      #  rio('bigfile.mp3').bytes(1024)[0]
      # While this reads *all* records from a file and returns the first one
      #  rio('bigfile.mp3').bytes(1024).to_a[0]
      # 
      # === Directories
      # 
      # This combines the entry selection offered by IF::GrandeEntry#entries with
      # the conversion to an array provided by IF::Grande#to_a. The following two are equivelant:
      #  ario[*args]
      #  ario.entries(*args).to_a
      #
      # Arguments may consist of strings (treated as globs) or regular expressions. 
      # An empty argument list selects all entries
      # See ::Dir#glob and ::File::fnmatch? for more in information on _globs_. 
      # Be warned that using the '**' glob
      # recurses into directories independently of IF::GrandeEntry#all and using both is unsupported.
      # 
      #  ario = rio('adir')
      #  ario[] # returns an array containg all entries in _adir_
      #  ario[/^zippy/] # all entries starting with 'zippy'
      #  ario['zippy*'] # same thing
      #
      # As with IF::Grande#each:
      # * Files and directories are returned as Rios
      # * The types of entries is also affected by IF::GrandeEntry#files and IF::GrandeEntry#dirs.
      #    rio('adir').files['*.txt'] # array of all .txt files
      #    rio('adir').dirs(/^\./) # array of all dot directories
      # * Recursion is enabled using IF::GrandeEntry#all
      #    rio('adir').all.files['*.[ch]'] # array of c source files in adir and its subdirecories
      #    rio('adir').all.dirs[/^\.svn/]  # array of subversion directories in adir and subdirectories
      # * IF::GrandeEntry#files and IF::GrandeEntry#dirs act independetly of each other. 
      #   Specifying both will cause both to be returned. 
      #   The argument list to IF::Grande#[] will be applied to the closest.
      #    rio('adir').files('*.rb').dirs['ruby*'] # array of .rb files and 
      #                                            # directories starting with 'ruby'
      #    rio('adir').dirs('ruby*').files['*.rb'] # same thing
      #
      # === Lines
      # This section applies similarly to IF::GrandeStream#lines, IF::GrandeStream#bytes, 
      # IF::GrandeStream#records, and IF::GrandeStream#rows
      #
      # Using IF::GrandeStream#lines and related methods with a Rio referencing a directory 
      # imples IF::GrandeEntry#files and will cause an array of the lines or bytes in the 
      # files to be returned. As above,
      # the arguments to the subscript operator will be applied to the closest.
      #  rio('adir').lines[] # array of all lines in the files in 'adir'
      #  rio('adir').files.lines[] # same thing
      #  rio('adir').lines(0..9).files['*.txt'] # array of the first ten lines of all .txt files
      #  rio('adir').files('*.txt').lines[0..9] # same thing
      #  rio('adir').all.files('*.rb').lines[/^\s*require/] # array of 'require' lines in .rb files in
      #                                                     # 'adir and its subdirectories
      #
      # Note the difference between the following similar usages
      #  it1 = rio('adir').files('*.rb') # returns a Rio, prepared for selecting ruby files
      #  it2 = rio('adir').files['*.rb'] # returns an array of the ruby files
      #
      # The second example above could have been written
      #  it2 = it1.to_a
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #  rio('afile.txt').lines[1..2] # array containing the 2nd and 3rd line
      # 
      #  rio('afile.txt')[1,3..5] # array containing lines 1,3,4 and 5
      # 
      #  rio('afile.txt')[/Zippy/] # array of all lines containing 'Zippy'
      # 
      #  rio('afile.txt')[1,3..5,/Zippy/] # array with lines 1,3,4 and 5 and all lines containing 'Zippy'
      # 
      #  rio('afile.dat').bytes(50)[] # array containing the contents of afile.dat broken up into 50 byte chunks
      #
      #  rio('afile.dat').bytes(50)[0,2] # array containing the first and third such chunk
      #  
      #  rio('afile.dat').bytes(50).records[0,2] # same thing
      #  
      #  rio('afile.dat').bytes(50).records(0,2).to_a # once again
      #
      #  rio('afile.csv').csv[0..9] # array of the first 10 records of afile.csv parsed by the ::CSV module
      #
      #  rio('afile.csv').csv.records[0..9] # same thing
      #
      #  rio('afile.csv').csv(';').records[0..9] # same thing using semi-colon as the value separator
      #  
      #  rio('afile.csv').csv.records[0,/Zippy/] # record 0 and all records containing 'Zippy'
      #                                          # the regexp is matched against the line before parsing by ::CSV

      # Iterate through a rio. Executes the block for each item selected for the Rio. 
      # See IF::GrandeStream#lines, IF::GrandeStream#records, IF::GrandeStream#bytes, 
      # IF::GrandeEntry#files, IF::GrandeEntry#dirs, IF::Grande#[] 
      # and IF::Grande#to_a for more information
      # on how records are selected and what kind of record is passed to the block.
      # 
      # IF::Grande#each is the fundemental method for all the Rio grande operators.
      # IF::Grande#to_a and the Rio copy operators 
      # IF::Grande#<, IF::Grande#<<, IF::Grande#>>, and IF::Grande#> 
      # are all implemented in terms of IF::Grande#each.
      #
      # While IF::Grande#each is fundamental to a Rio, it rarely needs 
      # actually be called because all the grande configuration methods will also take a block 
      # and call IF::Grande#each if one is given. 
      # So the existance of a block after many methods is taken as an implied
      # IF::Grande#each
      #
      # For Rios that refer to files, the item passed to the block is a String containing
      # the line or block as selected by IF::GrandeStream#lines, or IF::GrandeStream#bytes. 
      # +lines+ is the default.
      #  rio('afile').lines.each { |line| ...}
      # 
      # The block passed to +each+ will also accept an optional second parameter which will contain
      # the result of the matching function. What this variable contains depends on the argument
      # to +lines+ that resulted in the match as follows:
      # 
      # Regexp::   The MatchData that resulted from the match.
      # Range::    The record number of the matching record.
      # Fixnum::   The record number of the matching record.
      # Proc::     The value returned by the proc.
      # Symbol::   The value resulting from sending the symbol to the String.
      #
      # If no selection arguments were used, this variable will simply contain +true+.
      #
      #  rio(??).puts(%w[0:zero 1:one]).rewind.lines(/(\d+):([a-z]+)/) do |line,match| 
      #    puts("#{match[1]} is spelled '#{match[2]}'")
      #  end
      # 
      # Produces:
      #  0 is spelled 'zero'
      #  1 is spelled 'one'
      #
      # 
      # For Rios that refer to directories, the item passed to the block is a Rio refering to
      # the directory entry. 
      #
      #  rio('adir').files.each do |file|
      #    file.kind_of?(RIO::Rio)  # true
      #  end
      # 
      # In addition, the Rio passed to the block inherits certain attributes from the directory Rio.
      #
      #  rio('adir').files.chomp.each do |file| # chomp is ignored for directories,
      #    file.each do |line|                  # chomp attribute is inherited by the file rio
      #      # .. line is chomped
      #    end
      #  end
      #
      # IF::Grande#each returns the Rio which called it.

      # Grande Copy-To Operator
      # 
      # The copy grande-operator copies a Rio to a another Rio or another ruby object. The behaviour 
      # and the library used depend on the types of the of the source and destination. For
      # simple file or directory copying ::FileUtils#cp or ::FileUtils#cp_r will be used. If
      # any of the Rio grande methods are specified for the source or destination, the
      # source Rio will be iterated through copying records to the destintion as specified. Roughly
      # equivelant to
      #  dst = rio('dst_file')
      #  rio('src_file').each do |line|
      #    dst.print(line)
      #  end
      #  dst.close
      #
      # The destination of the copy operators may be a:
      # IO::      Each record of the Rio is written to the IO using IO#print. The IO must be opened for writing.
      # Array::   Each record or entry of the Rio becomes an element of the array
      # String::  Puts the entire contents of the Rio into the string
      # Rio::     Depends on the destination. See below.
      #
      # Copy a file to a file

      # Grande Pipe Operator
      # 
      # The Rio pipe operator is actually an alternative syntax for calling the copy-to operator, designed to 
      # allow several copy operation to be performed in one line of code, with behaviour that mimics
      # the pipe operator commonly available in shells.
      #
      # If +destination+ is a +cmdio+, a <tt>cmdpipe</tt> Rio is returned, and none of the commands are run.
      #
      # Otherwise the +cmdpipe+ Rio is run with the output of the pipe being copied to the destination.
      # In this case a Rio representing the +destination+ is returned.
      # 
      # If destination is not a Rio it is passed to the Rio constructor as is done with the copy-to operator
      # except that if +destination+ is a String it is assumed to be a command instead of a path.
      #
      #  rio('afile') | rio(?-,'grep i') | rio(?-) # returns rio(?-)
      #                                            # equivelent to rio(?-, 'grep i') < rio('afile') > rio(?-)
      #
      #  rio('infile') | rio(?-, 'acmd') | rio(?-, 'acmd2') | rio('outfile')
      #  # same as
      #  # acmd = rio(?-,'acmd')
      #  # acmd2 = rio(?-,'acmd2')
      #  # out = rio('outfile')
      #  # acmd < rio('infile')
      #  # acmd2 < acmd
      #  # out < acmd2
      # 
      #  rio('afile') | 'acmd' | 'acmd2' | rio('outfile') # same thing
      #
      #  acmdpipe = rio(?-,'acmd') | 'acmd2'
      #  rio('afile') | acmdpipe | rio('outfile') # same thing
      #
      #  acmdpipe1 = rio(?|,'acmd','acmd2')
      #  rio('afile') | acmdpipe1 | rio('outfile') # same thing
      #
      #  acmdpipe2 = rio('afile') | 'acmd' | 'acmd2'
      #  acmdpipe2 | rio('outfile') # same thing
      #
      # The grande pipe operator can not be used to create a +cmdpipe+ Rio that includes a destination.
      # This must be done using a Rio constructor
      #  cmd_with_output = rio(?|,'acmd',rio('outfile'))
      #  rio('afile') | cmd_with_output # same as above

      # Grande Append-To Operator
      # 
      # The append-to grande-operator is the same as IF::Grande#> (copy-to) except that it opens the destination
      # for append.
      # The destination can be a kind of:
      # IO::     Each record of the Rio is written to the IO using IO#print. The IO must be opened for writing.
      # Array::  Each record or entry of the Rio is appended to the destination array
      # String:: Appends the entire contents of the Rio to destination
      # Rio::    Just like IF::Grande#> (copy-to) except the unopened object are 
      #          opened for append. If the destination is already opened for writing or is a 
      #          directory, this is identical to IF::Grande#> (copy-to) 
      #
      # See IF::Grande#> (copy-to)
      # 
      #  rio('afile') >> rio('anotherfile') # append the contents of 'afile' to 'anotherfile'
      #  rio('afile') >> rio('adir') # copies 'afile' to the directory 'adir'
      #  rio('adir') >> rio('anotherdir') # copy directory 'adir' recursively to 'anotherdir' 
      #  rio('adir') >> array # a Rio for each entry in the directory will be appended to ary
      def >>(destination) target >> destination; self end

      
      # Alias for IF::Grande#>> (append-to grande operator)
      def append_to(destination) target.append_to(destination); self end


      # Grande Append-From Operator
      # 
      # The append-from grande-operator copies a Rio from another Rio or another ruby object. This
      # behaves like IF::Grande#< (copy-from) except unopened Rios are opened for append.
      #
      # The following summarizes how objects are copied:
      # IO::       IO#each is used to iterate through the source with each record appended to the Rio
      # Array::    Each element of the Array is appended individually to the Rio.
      # String::   The string is appended to the Rio using IF::RubyIO#print
      # Rio::      The source Rio is appended using its IF::Grande#>> (append-to) operator
      # 
      # See IF::Grande#< (copy-from)
      def <<(source) target << source; self end


      # Alias for IF::Grande#<< (append-from grande operator)
      def append_from(source) target.append_from(source); self end


      # Grande Copy-From Operator
      # 
      # The copy-from grande-operator copies a Rio from another Rio or another ruby object. 
      # Its operation is dependent on the the file system objects referenced, the rio
      # options set, and the state of its source and destination. In the broadest of terms
      # it could be described as doing the following:
      #    source.each do |entry|
      #      destination << entry
      #    end
      # That is to say, it iterates through its argument, calling the copy-from operator
      # again for each element. While it is not implemented like this, and the above code would
      # not give the same results, This generalized description is convenient.
      #
      # For example the code:
      #
      #  destination < source
      #  # is like
      #  source.each { |element| destination << element }
      #
      # for any of the following definitions of src and dst
      # * copying files
      #    src = rio('afile')
      #    dst = rio('acopy')
      # * copying parts of files
      #    src = rio('afile').lines(0..9)
      #    dst = rio('acopy')
      # * copying directories
      #    src = rio('srcdir')
      #    dst = rio('dstdir')
      # * copy directories selectively
      #    src = rio('srcdir').dirs(/^\./).files('*.tmp')
      #    dst = rio('dstdir')
      # * copying to a file from an array
      #    src = ["line0\n","line1\n"]
      #    dst = rio('afile')
      # * copying to a directory from an array
      #    array = [rio("file1"),rio("file2")]
      #    dst = rio('adir')
      # 
      # Arrays are handled differently depending on whether the rio references a file or a directory.
      # * If the destination is a file. 
      #    dest = rio('afile') 
      #    dest < array
      #    # is roughly equivelent to
      #    array.each do |el|
      #      case el
      #      when ::String then dest.print(el)
      #      when ::Rio then dest << el
      #      else dest << rio(el)
      #    end
      # * If the destination is a directory
      #    dest = rio('adir') 
      #    dest < array
      #    # is roughly equivelent to
      #    array.each do |el|
      #      case el
      #      when ::String then rio(el)
      #      when ::Rio then dest << el
      #      else dest << rio(el)
      #    end
      #
      # To improve run-time efficiency, Rio will choose from among several strategies when
      # copying. For instance when no file or directory filtering is specified, FileUtils#cp_r is
      # used to copy directories; and when no line filtering is specified, FileUtils#cp is used to copy
      # files.
      #
      #  rio('adir') < rio('anotherdir') # 'anotherdir' is copied to 'adir' using FileUtils#cp_r
      #  rio('adir') < rio('anotherdir').files('*.rb') # copy only .rb files
      #  rio('afile') < rio('anotherfile') # 'anotherfile' is copied to 'afile' using FileUtils#cp
      #  rio('afile') < ios # ios must be an IO object opened for reading
      #  rio('afile') < astring # basically the same as rio('afile').print(astring)
      #
      #  anarray = [ astring, rio('anotherfile') ] 
      #  rio('afile') < anarray # copies each element to 'afile' as if one had written
      #     ario = rio('afile')
      #     anarray.each do |el| 
      #       ario << el
      #     end
      #     ario.close

      # ignored.
