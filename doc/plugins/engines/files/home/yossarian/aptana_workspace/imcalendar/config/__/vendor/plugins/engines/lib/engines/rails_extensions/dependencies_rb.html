One of the magic features that that engines plugin provides is the ability
to override selected methods in controllers and helpers from your
application. This is achieved by trapping requests to load those files, and
then mixing in code from plugins (in the order the plugins were loaded)
before finally loading any versions from the main <tt>app</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
The behaviour of this extension is output to the log file for help when
debugging.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
A plugin contains the following controller in
<tt>plugin/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
  class MyController &lt; ApplicationController
    def index
      @name = &quot;HAL 9000&quot;
    end
    def list
      @robots = Robot.find(:all)
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
In one application that uses this plugin, we decide that the name used in
the index action should be &quot;Robbie&quot;, not &quot;HAL 9000&quot;. To
override this single method, we create the corresponding controller in our
application (<tt>RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>), and
redefine the method:
</p>
<pre>
  class MyController &lt; ApplicationController
    def index
      @name = &quot;Robbie&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The list method remains as it was defined in the plugin controller.
</p>
<p>
The same basic principle applies to helpers, and also views and partials
(although view overriding is performed in <a
href="../../../../../../../../../../../../../classes/Engines/RailsExtensions/Templates.html">Engines::RailsExtensions::Templates</a>;
see that module for more information).
</p>
<h3>What about models?</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, it&#8216;s not possible to provide this kind of magic for
models. The only reason why it&#8216;s possible for controllers and helpers
is because they can be recognised by their filenames
(&quot;whatever_controller&quot;, &quot;jazz_helper&quot;), whereas models
appear the same as any other typical Ruby library (&quot;node&quot;,
&quot;user&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, etc.).
</p>
<p>
If mixing were allowed in models, it would mean code mixing for
<b>every</b> file that was loaded via <tt>require_or_load</tt>, and this
could result in problems where, for example, a Node model might start to
include functionality from another file called &quot;node&quot; somewhere
else in the <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt>.
</p>
<p>
One way to overcome this is to provide model functionality as a module in a
plugin, which developers can then include into their own model
implementations.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to provide an abstract model (see the ActiveRecord::Base
documentation) and have developers subclass this model in their own
application if they must.
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
The <a
href="../../../../../../../../../../../../../classes/Engines/RailsExtensions/Dependencies.html">Engines::RailsExtensions::Dependencies</a>
module includes a method to override Dependencies.require_or_load, which is
called to load code needed by <a
href="../../../../../../../../../../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
as it encounters constants that aren&#8216;t defined.
</p>
<p>
This method is enhanced with the code-mixing features described above.
